**Questions**
Event TYM.136.d: \n\n"The Union is Stalin, Nikita. All I did, all I do, and all I will ever do, is to make sure that little ember, that ideal born with Lenin, refined by Stalin, and lived by us each waking moment, doesn't fade with the cold winds; it's a cruel world out there, and you of all people should know it."znNikita's fists clenched, his scowl deepening as Kaganovich stares at him, utterly unphased.
Maybe unfazed instead of unphased?
